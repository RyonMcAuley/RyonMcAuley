About

I like clean configurations, readable code, and setups that behave
the same way twice.

Current focus

Neovim (lazy.nvim, modular Lua)

Linux / WSL / Arch-based systems

C#, Java, and small scripts that glue things together

Observability and operational clarity

Notes

I prefer boring tools that work

I change my config more often than my editor

Coffee is part of the feedback loo
