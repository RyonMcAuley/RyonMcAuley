# Hi, I'm Ryon 👋

I build things that sit at the intersection of **systems, tooling, and developer experience**. I like clean configs, readable code, and setups that feel intentional rather than accidental.

## 🧰 What I Work With

* Neovim (lazy.nvim, modular Lua configs)
* Linux / WSL / Arch-based distros
* C#, Java, and scripting where it makes sense
* Observability and telemetry (logs, metrics, traces)

## 🧠 Current Interests

* Window managers and minimal Linux setups (Hyprland, Wayland)
* Improving local dev workflows
* Making complex systems easier to reason about

## ☕ Side Quests

* Dialing in espresso and milk texture
* Learning just enough about coffee science to be dangerous

## 📫 Elsewhere

* GitHub is where the experiments live
* Commits tend to come in bursts, usually after too much coffee

---

*I value clarity, curiosity, and tools that get out of the way.*
